            <h1>INSTALLING NODE</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                The most convenient way of installing Node.js depends on the host system you'll be working 
                with. Below, the procedures for most major desktop Operating Systems are given. <b>If you use
                    Linux, 
                </b>
                keep in mind that it is considered dangerous and unnecessary to run <tt>sudo npm</tt>, as this can 
                cause annoying package-management issues.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>Windows NT</h1>
            <div style="float:left; width:400px; padding:10px;">
                For Windows users, Node.js can be downloaded as a <tt>.msi</tt> Windows Installer file from 
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">the Official Node.js Website.</a> It is recommended, unless you know 
                what you're doing, that you download the LTS (Long-Term-Support) version, as it may contain fewer 
                undocumented bugs.
                <br><br>
                If you don't have administrative privileges on your machine, a binary version in a zipped folder exists that may 
                be downloaded and extracted to your user directory, and this directory added to your <tt>path</tt> variable. 
            </div>
            <div style="float:right; width:400px; padding:10px;">
                If you downloaded the <tt>.msi</tt> version of Node, you only need to double-click the file (wherever you put it) 
                and follow the on-screen prompts to complete installation. After this, Node should have added its own location 
                to your <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable. If you downloaded the zipped binary, you will have to add the <tt>bin</tt> 
                folder to your <tt>PATH</tt> manually.
                <br><br>
                To check that everything is working, open up a command prompt and type the following:
                <br><br>
                <tt><b>> node -v</b></tt>
                <br>
                <tt><b>> npm -v</b></tt>
            </div>
            <br style="clear:both;">
            <br>

            <h1>macOS</h1>
            <div style="float:left; width:400px; padding:10px;">
                For macOS users, Node.js can be downloaded as a <tt>.pkg</tt> Installer Package file, also from
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">the Official Node.js Website.</a> Again, the LTS version is recommended 
                for most users.
                <br><br>
                A tarballed macOS binary exists for both Intel and ARM 64-bit processors, whose purpose is similar to the 
                zipped folder provided for Windows users.
            </div>
            <div style="float:right; width:400px; padding:10px;">
                The installation procedure for Node is similar to any other Mac application. Once complete, Node should be 
                recognised by the terminal, which you can check with the following:
                <br><br>
                <tt><b>$ node -v</b></tt>
                <br>
                <tt><b>$ npm -v</b></tt>
            </div>
            <br style="clear:both;">
            <br>

            <h1>Linux</h1>
            <div style="float:left; width:400px; padding:10px;">
                For Linux users, Node.js is available on <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">the Official Node.js Website</a> 
                as prebuilt binaries for either x86_64 or the ARMv7 and ARMv8 instruction set architectures. All of these 
                binaries are distributed as <tt>.xz</tt>-compressed tarballs, and should work with any distribution supporting 
                the listed architectures (which would include Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, etc.). 
                <br><br>
                <b>While Node.js can also be installed using a distribution's package manager,</b> this is NOT recommended, 
                as many package managers only list outdated versions of Node.js, and at any rate, setting up Node.js as a 
                binary for individual accounts on a Linux machine is easier and, in some ways, safer, than installing it 
                with superuser privileges.
            </div>
            <div style="float:right; width:400px; padding:10px;">
                Once you have the binaries for Node downloaded, extract them with the following: 
                <br><br>
                <tt><b>$ tar -xf node-vxx.xx.x-linux-isa.tar.xz</b></tt>
                <br><br>
                Once extracted, add the directory they landed in to your <tt>path</tt> and check that they are recognised 
                with the following: 
                <br><br>
                <tt><b>$ node -v</b></tt>
                <br>
                <tt><b>$ npm -v</b></tt>
            </div>
            <br style="clear:both;">
            <br>
            <div>
