            <h1>INSTALLING MONGODB</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                MongoDB is available for a variety of Operating Systems running on a variety of processor 
                architectures, under the Server Side Public License. This means that it is free to use, but not 
                necessarily "open-source", in the traditional sense. For clarity, see the <a href="./home.html#extlnks">External Links</a> 
                of the home page and go to MongoDB's official website.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>Windows NT</h1>
            <div style="padding:10px;">
                For Windows users, MongoDB Server Community edition (the version that is free to use) can be downloaded as 
                a <tt>.msi</tt> Windows Installer executable, which will run you through the standard setup configuration steps. 
                One of the options you will be presented with is MongoDB's Compass GUI; having this isn't necessary for setting up 
                a basic API, but is handy if you find working from a terminal annoying. Keep in mind, however, that it will use up 
                more space on disk.
                <br><br>
                The other Windows option is a <tt>.zip</tt>-compressed prebuilt binary, which is useful (similar to the setup of 
                Node.js) when you don't have administrative privileges.
            </div>

            <h1>macOS</h1>
            <div style="padding:10px;">
                MongoDB for macOS comes in two variants, standard (for Intel processors) and ARM64 (for newer Apple machines), which 
                must be selected from MongoDB's download dropdown box separately, rather than as sub-entries under a standard 
                "macOS" field. Both come in <tt>.tgz</tt> tarball format, so be aware of which option you select.
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h1>Linux</h1>
            <div style="padding:10px;">
                MongoDB has wider support for Linux distributions than many other modern applications, which may be due, in part, 
                to Linux's popularity as a server OS, given that MongoDB will only ever be practically deployed server-side. 
                Supported distributions include the latest versions of Debian, Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Redhat/CentOS, and SUSE. 
                Most of these are supported on both Intel and ARM processors.
                <br><br>
                Older versions of these distributions are also supported, but only if you are willing to downgrade from MongoDB 
                6.0.2. You can also obtain the source code, if you know what you are doing.

            <div style="padding:10px;">
                When it comes time to actually <i>use</i> MongoDB, you can start up an instance from the shell, or
